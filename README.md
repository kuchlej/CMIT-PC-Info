# CMIT-PC-Info - Collects PC information for assessment for MSP
#The 1-5 file is to create a copy of the information to the current directory on the drive on which this file is saved.
#Recommended usage: Put this on a flash drive and run it on each PC individually, this will add a line per machine in an excel spreadsheet containing basic details and create a text file with the PC name with some additional details. 
#The EndUser-1-1 file is intended to run by end users in the event that they have users that aren't in the main location or if they have home users with business-owned computers and we need to assess those.
